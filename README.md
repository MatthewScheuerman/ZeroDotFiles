.dotfile configs for a Raspberry Pi Zero as a Desktop (EXPERIMENTAL)

This is my attempt to create ways to use something as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero as a (somewhat) usable Desktop.

If it can run on a Zero, it can run on a Pi 4. 

My reasons behind this? I had an old-ish Zero around that wasn't being used, and I wanted to create configs for a future Raspberry Pi 4 4gb model that I will use as a desktop in the future.
